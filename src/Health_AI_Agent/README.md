
**Project Summary**

  - This project implements a Multi-Agent AI Platform for Natural Language Data Querying across 10,000+ enterprise tables. The system allows business users, analysts, and healthcare teams to interact with large-scale enterprise data using natural language instead of complex SQL queries.
  
  - Traditional enterprise data environments contain thousands of tables distributed across multiple datasets, making it difficult for non-technical users to locate the correct tables, understand schema relationships, and generate accurate queries. This platform addresses that challenge by combining AI agents, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and automated SQL generation to provide an intelligent interface for enterprise analytics.
  
  - The system uses a cooperative multi-agent architecture where specialized agents perform different tasks such as policy validation, SQL generation, result verification, data analysis, and report generation. These agents work together to transform user questions into structured data queries, retrieve relevant information, validate the results, and produce actionable insights.

  - The platform is deployed as a cloud-native application using a FastAPI service and runs in a scalable serverless environment.

**Why We Built This System**

  - Large enterprise organizations often manage massive data ecosystems with thousands of tables and complex schemas. Accessing and interpreting this data typically requires:
      - knowledge of database schema
      - strong SQL expertise
      - familiarity with multiple data sources
      - manual analysis workflows

This creates several challenges:

1. Data Accessibility

Business users cannot easily access data because they lack technical SQL skills. Analysts and data engineers become bottlenecks for answering simple questions.

2. Schema Complexity

With 10,000+ tables, identifying the correct tables and relationships becomes difficult even for experienced engineers.

3. Knowledge Fragmentation

Important documentation such as data dictionaries, governance policies, and metadata are often stored separately in portals or documents.

4. Compliance and Governance

In regulated environments such as healthcare, data access must comply with strict governance rules. Queries must respect policies and avoid exposing restricted information.

5. Slow Analytics Workflow

Traditional data workflows involve multiple steps:

User → Analyst → SQL query → Validation → Report

This slows down decision making.

**Solution Approach**

  This system solves the problem by introducing a multi-agent AI architecture where each agent specializes in a specific task:

- SQL Agent converts natural language into optimized SQL queries
- RAG Policy Agent retrieves governance rules and documentation
- QA Agent validates query results and prevents hallucinations
- Analyst Agent transforms raw data into insights
- Report/Action Agent generates final responses and recommendations

  By coordinating these agents, the system can automatically:

- interpret natural language questions
- locate relevant datasets
- generate and execute SQL queries
- validate the results
- produce business insights

**Key Benefits**
- Natural Language Data Access
  : Users can ask questions directly instead of writing SQL queries.

- Scalable Data Discovery
  : The platform can operate across thousands of enterprise tables.

Governance and Compliance

Policy-aware retrieval ensures data usage follows governance rules.

Faster Decision Making

Automates complex analytics workflows and reduces reliance on manual data analysis.

Intelligent Data Insights

Provides summarized results, trends, and actionable recommendations.

Target Use Cases

This system is designed for enterprise environments such as:

healthcare analytics

insurance risk analysis

population health management

customer analytics

operational intelligence

Example Queries

Users can ask questions such as:

Which members have diabetes risk?

Show members with high cardiovascular risk.

Identify members with multiple chronic conditions.

Which members have hospitalization risk greater than 0.7?

The platform automatically translates these questions into structured queries and provides validated insights.

Multi-Agent AI System for Enterprise Data Query
AI-powered platform that enables natural language querying of 10,000+ enterprise tables using a multi-agent architecture, RAG pipelines, and SQL automation.

The system allows business users to ask questions such as:

  Which members have diabetes risk?
  Show members with high cardiovascular risk.
  Members with hospitalization risk above threshold.
  Members with chronic disease indicators.
  
The platform automatically translates these questions into SQL queries, policy-aware retrieval, analytics, and reports.
